\section{Title}

Content-Based Video Retrieval Experiment

\section{What is the project about?}

This dissertation project aims to create a system similar to Shazam for movies. 
For background information, Shazam is a mobile application that allows users to match a recording to a piece of music.\\

The goal of this project is to explore how such a system could be developed to work with movies, where a user would record a screen with his phone, which will pattern match the movie to a database of movies and accurately return the movie title.

\section{Your role in this experiment}

In this experiment, you play the role of the algorithm that matches a user recording to one of the videos in the database.\\

You will be shown 6 videos from the database, followed by 1 user-recorded video.\\

Your goal is to mentally compare the recorded video to each video in the database to be able to rank each database video from most likely to match the recorded video to least likely.\\

When making your decision, take into account aspects of the video such as colour distribution, luminosity, textures, shapes, objects and motion, as a video matching algorithm would in real life.\\

Note: The data retrieved from this experiment will be compared to the results the of the project's matching algorithm. It will remain anonymous in locally-stored hard copies and in the final report. By submitting this form, you give consent for your data to be evaluated and used in the report. You may withdraw from the experiment at any time.

\section{Watch}

Watch the 6 database videos that will train your "knowledge".\\

Database Videos: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvukbK-sX9A}.\\

Now watch the recorded query video. Your goal is now to compare this video to the 6 previous videos you watched and to rank them based on their visual similarities.\\

Query Video: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JPo0-aSzNE}.

\section{Rank}

\textbf{Which database video does the recorded query match the most?}\\

See Figure \ref{fig:appendix_survey_video_ranking}\\

\textbf{Which video aspects did you consider the most when ranking them?}\\

Placeholder for long answer from participant.\\

\textbf{What do you think is the most important aspect of a video that a matching algorithm should analyse when pattern matching videos?}\\

Placeholder for short answer from participant.
