An example of the console output produced, depicting the initial option to stabilise the query video, followed by a request to manually select the ROI, followed by a printing of the results. The results are printed in the form of tables for each histogram model and each distance metric used, with the match found located under table. Global results are printed at the end of the program, in parallel to the histogram and figure displayed with Matplotlib for a visual representation of the results.\\

This example console output uses the skewed butterfly query and six database videos in order to fit within a small minimum amount of pages.
