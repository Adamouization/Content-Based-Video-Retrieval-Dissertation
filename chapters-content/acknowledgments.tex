I would like to start by thanking my project supervisor, Dr. Yong-Liang Yang, for his precious help and guidance during this project, and for his lightning fast replies to my emails.\\

I would also like to thank all my family and friends, and most importantly my mother, father, and sister, for all their love and support throughout my life and studies.
