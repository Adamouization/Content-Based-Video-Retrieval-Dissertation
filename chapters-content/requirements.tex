This chapter establishes the requirements of the system. These requirements were devised in response to the problems mentioned in Section \ref{sec:problem-description} of Chapter \ref{ch:chapter1} and to the results of an experiment conducted through an online survey, and builds upon the information provided by the Literature and Technology Survey in Chapter \ref{ch:chapter2}.\\

The following requirements are divided between non-functional and functional sections, which are further split into more specific sections. They are prioritised using the words \textit{must} (Priority 1), \textit{should} (Priority 2) and \textit{may} (Priority 3); where \textit{must} indicates a crucial requirement to the system, \textit{should} an optimal requirement and \textit{may} a beneficial requirement.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{System Requirements}

\subsubsection{Offline Feature Extraction Phase}

These requirements concern the offline feature extraction phase\footnote{The learning phase in a classifier ingesting static unsupervised data.} of the system, where static database videos are ingested by the system and features are extracted from each video and stored in files for the next phase.

\begin{enumerate}[label=F\arabic*]

    \item \textbf{The system \underline{must} run this phase a single time without requiring to be executed again for the next phase}.\\
    The features stored in files must be re-used in the next phase rather than being generated every time. The system \textbf{must} re-ingest the data whenever a change is carried out in the database e.g. a video has been added or a video has been removed.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{Simple features that are proven to work efficiently with videos \underline{must} be chosen to be extracted.}\\
    Due to the nature of the project, a line must be drawn between the complexity of the feature being extracted to represent the videos and the efficiency of working with such a feature. For example, if the feature is very complicated to extract and use, but does not offer many more advantages than a simpler feature to extract and use, then the simpler feature should be used.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{must} store the extracted features it used for learning in files for future re-use in the online retrieval phase.}\\
    Files can be saved either in plain text ``\textit{.txt}'' file format to be human-readable, or in other file formats such as binary ``\textit{.dat}'' files.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The files containing the training data \underline{must} be able to be quickly loaded into memory during the matching phase.}\\
    To minimise additional time spent on I/O operations, the files should be loaded quickly using efficient functions designed for this type of operation. If necessary, an external third-party library may be used to provided functions for quicker I/O operations.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The system's interface \underline{should} specify that it is ingesting and extracting features from the database videos.}\\
    It can do so by either displaying a loading spinner or by iteratively printing text specifying which video is being currently processed.\\
    Priority 2.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Online Retrieval Phase}

These requirements concern the retrieval phase\footnote{The matching phase of a classifier where the extracted features of a query video are compared to each database video's extracted feature.} of the system, where the same extracted features from the previous phase are extracted from the query video and compared to the stored features from each database video by calculating the distance between between these features.

\begin{enumerate}[label=F\arabic*,resume]

    \item \textbf{The system \underline{must} accept a pre-recorded video as input.}\\
    This pre-recorded video will serve as the query video.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{must} crop the recorded video to select a ``region of interest''.}\\
    The system must ignore the pixels outside of the selected area of the clip when extracting its features.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{must} use well-known distance metrics to calculate the distances between the query's feature vectors and the database videos' feature vectors.}\\
    Hundreds of metrics exist, but some are more efficient for the task at hand. A good indication that a distance metric is good for the task at hand is its availability for popular programming languages and their mainstream third-party libraries.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{must} display the results once the classification has been completed.}\\
    The retrieved video \textbf{must} be emphasised over the other videos to clearly point out that the result has been found. Additional results such as individual distances between the query and each video can be displayed as well e.g. tables.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{must} be evaluated using reliable performance measurements.}\\
    The accuracy of the system should be calculated for different queries.
    Priority 1.
    
    % The accuracy of the system can be measured through a confusion matrix (or contigency table) to calculate the acusing the number of true positives and:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item True Positives:
    %     \item False Positives:
    % \end{itemize}
    % Additionally, the runtime can be measure\\
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{should} stabilise the query video before extracting its features.}\\
    The stabilised video will diminish the effects of camera movement and increase the similarities between the video's extracted features and the database videos' features.\\
    Priority 2.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{may} be able to directly record a query video.}\\
    Processing the query video while it is being recorded would drastically improve the system's runtime in this phase rather than waiting for the entire video to be recorded and only processing it after the recording is finished.\\
    Priority 3.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{may} find a match to the query in less than 10 seconds.}\\
    Commercial applications usually take around 10 seconds to produce a match to the query. Therefore, this project should take roughly the same amount of time before producing an output.\\
    Priority 3.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Database Pre-processing}

These requirements concern the database pre-processing phase of the system. This phase would be used before the two previously mentioned phases, and concerns the operations to carry out the the database videos to improve the offline feature extraction and online retrieval phases.

\begin{enumerate}[label=F\arabic*,resume]

    \item \textbf{Long videos, e.g. feature-length movies, \underline{must} be processed for shot boundary detection to segment them into scenes.}\\
    A single frame must be used to represent each shot of a long video. However, this is not required if the video is short enough to be a shot by itself.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The same features from the offline feature extraction and online retrieval phases \underline{should} be used for the shot boundary detection algorithm.}\\
    This would ensure cohesion between different phases of the program and allow code to be re-used.
    Priority 2.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{General Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=F\arabic*,resume]

    \item \textbf{The MVP\footnote{Minimum Viable Product} \underline{must} at least be a Command Line Interface that accepts command line inputs to run different phases of the program and enable/disable options.}\\
    A simple CLI is the minimum interface required to run the system with different arguments and to display results.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{must} be able to run on a machine equipped with a terminal.}\\
    Any machine running Windows, Mac or Linux distributions should be able to run the system with the correct project dependencies installed.\\
    Priority 1.
        
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{should} include a ``README'' file with instructions on how to run the system.}\\
    The ``README'' file allows the system to be accessible to other users with the appropriate background knowledge to install the pre-required dependencies and run the system successfully.\\
    Priority 2.
    
    \item \textbf{The interface \underline{may} be a graphical interface.}\\
    For example, it could be a simple HTML web page or a native UI desktop application (which will depend on the chosen programming language). This would allow for information to be more clearly displayed on the screen.\\
    Priority 3.
        
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Code Design Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=F\arabic*,resume]

    \item \textbf{The system's code \underline{must} be source controlled using Git and backed up on GitHub in a private repository.}\\
    This will enable the code to be safely backed and offer a timeline of the system's development phase.\\
    Priority 1.
    	
	\item \textbf{The system \underline{should} follow coding style guidelines set for the programming language of choice.}\\
	This will ensure that the code will be written at the highest standard by following professional practices and will be more easily readable by industry experts.\\
	Priority 2.

	\item \textbf{The system \underline{should} use third-party libraries for complex aspects of the software to avoid rewriting complicated code that already exists and is easily accessible.}\\
	Rewriting code that already exists could be a waste of time for a project with such as shirt time-frame. Therefore, using third-party libraries will mean more time can be spent designing and implementing high-level concepts of the system.\\
	Priority 2.

    \item \textbf{The system \underline{may} be covered with unit tests and integration tests.}\\
    To ensure that different core aspects of the system work as expected, unit tests can be written around these sections. Additionally, multiple core aspects can be tested as a whole with integration tests.\\
    Priority 3.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=F\arabic*,resume]

    \item \textbf{The videos used in the database \underline{must} not violate any copyright laws.}\\
    They must have licenses allowing them to be re-used for personal and commercial purposes at no cost.\\
    Priority 1.
    
    \item \textbf{The duration of the videos \underline{should} range from 7 to 14 seconds.}\\
    Working with short videos is enough to prove that the system pipeline works as intended since a considerable number of them can be used to populate the database, whereas only a handful of videos could be efficiently used if feature-length movies were used instead. 7 seconds is enough to ensure each video has at least 210 frames\footnote{Assuming videos with a frame rate of 30 fps.} to analyse.\\
    Priority 2.

    \item \textbf{There \underline{should} be a minimum of 50 unique videos in the database.}\\
    Because short videos rather than long ones are used to test the system pipeline, there should be a considerable amount of them to challenge the system.\\
    Priority 2.
    
    \item \textbf{The system pipeline \underline{may} be tested with a few feature-length movies as database videos.}\\
    The main goal of the project is to build the system pipeline, which can be tested with a database of many short videos rather than a database of a few long videos. To further explore the efficiency of the system, feature-length movies could be used to report the results when attempting to match them to a short query.\\
    Priority 3.
        
\end{enumerate}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=NF\arabic*]

    \item \textbf{The latest technologies \underline{must} be used to build the system.}\\
	The latest versions of programming languages and libraries must be used to ensure that the system takes advantage of up-to-date technology.\\
	Priority 1.
	
	\item \textbf{The system \underline{should} not be built with external users in mind.}\\
	It should only be run by the system's creator or users with a background in computer science who could understand how to run it using the README file provided.\\
	Priority 2.

    \item \textbf{The interface \underline{should} make the results easy to read.}\\
    This could be achieved with the use of large fonts, colours and bold text. Text used to discern the main results from less important output should be emphasized.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{may} run smoothly and uninterrupted.}\\
    Priority 3.
    
    \item \textbf{The system \underline{may} not crash or exit unexpectedly with no error message.}\\
    Priority 3.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary}

This chapter has summarised the requirements needed to design and implement a successful system based on the problems formulated in Chapter \ref{ch:chapter1} and the Literature and Technology Survey in Chapter \ref{ch:chapter2}. Now that the requirements have been established, different potential solutions will be explored in the next chapter, including the benefits and disadvantages of each method, before one solution can be chosen and implemented.
