\begin{itemize}
    \item state what could be improved with time
    \begin{itemize}
        \item region-based histograms, separate frame in 5 regions and generate a histogram for each region rather than having a global histogram to describe the frame (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/12/01/complete-guide-building-image-search-engine-python-opencv/)
        \item improve ROI selection to take 4 points rather than 2 (will increase accuracy for query videos that are at an angle, not filming the screen from a straight point of view)
        \item automatic ROI detection (detect screen edges with edge and corner detector algorithms)
        \item more features to complement the colour-based features (e.g. motion and shape features) and improve the accuracy
        \item make use of sound to further improve accuracy
        \item GUI e.g. Tkinter application or simple HTML webpage
    \end{itemize} 
    \item mention that with improvements, could have worked with small database of movies rather than short videos
    \item limitations of working with large database of movies: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item too much data to process, could perhaps be pre-processed in advance
        \item copyright issues of having all these movies
    \end{itemize}
