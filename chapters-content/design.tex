\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore possible options for different sections of the system, such as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item types of features to extract (why static colour features and not object/motion features) - histograms are very popular with videos, calculations are easier, implementation is easier, results are as efficient
        \item types of learning models (histogram matching, BoW-approacg VS Neural Network)
        \item programming language of choice:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item python VS MATLAB vs other languages
            \item rich array of libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, MatplotLib
            \item ease of installing third-party libraries with PIP
            \item powerful IDEs (PyCharm)
            \item ease of generating testing suites
            \item familiarity with
        \end{itemize}
        \item interface choice (why CLI VS GUI?): time constraints and no users, goal of this project is to research efficient results, not create a commercial product
        \item types of videos in databases (why short videos VS movies, cartoons/stop-motion pictures)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Finish by mentioning the final solution details.
    \item high-level diagram of system excluding detail (all DB videos in system, single query video in system, matching video output)
\end{itemize}
